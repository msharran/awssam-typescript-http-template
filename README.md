# Elevate User Service

## Use the npm to build and test locally

Watchs for build changes and runs build automatically

```bash
npm run-script watch
```

Start the api server locally

```bash
npm run-script serve
```

The SAM CLI can also emulate your application's API. Use the `sam local start-api` to run the API locally on port 3000.

```bash
elevate-user-service$ sam local start-api
elevate-user-service$ curl http://localhost:3000/
```
## Fetch, tail, and filter Lambda function logs

To simplify troubleshooting, SAM CLI has a command called `sam logs`. `sam logs` lets you fetch logs generated by your deployed Lambda function from the command line. In addition to printing the logs on the terminal, this command has several nifty features to help you quickly find the bug.

`NOTE`: This command works for all AWS Lambda functions; not just the ones you deploy using SAM.

```bash
elevate-user-service$ sam logs -n HelloWorldFunction --stack-name elevate-user-service --tail
```

You can find more information and examples about filtering Lambda function logs in the [SAM CLI Documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/serverless-sam-cli-logging.html).

## Cleanup

To delete the sample application that you created, use the AWS CLI. Assuming you used your project name for the stack name, you can run the following:

```bash
aws cloudformation delete-stack --stack-name elevate-user-service
```
